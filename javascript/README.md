## Javascript/UI/UX Coding Exercises

### #1: Pitch Visualization
For this task, we would like you to build a web page/app that presents pitches from TrackMan in any visualization you see fit. This could be a scatter plot, a heatmap, data tables, etc.

We have provided a data set that includes a set of Jon Lester's regular season pitches in 2016.

#### JSON Property Descriptions
- **location_x:** distance, in feet, of the ball from the middle of home plate as it crosses the front of the plate's plane. From the pitcher's perspective, negative values are left, positive right.
- **location_z:** height of the ball, in feet, as it crosses the front of the plate.
- **is_pa_pitch:** is true when this is the final pitch of an atbat

### #2: Roster Browser
For this exercise you will be developing a mini web application for viewing the Cubs MLB
team roster. 

Use the [roster.json](roster.json) file that describes the Cubs current roster to
drive your application.

Required Features:
* The user must be able to save and view short text notes on any player. You may use local storage for these notes to eliminate any need for a database.

## Delivery
Upon completion of either extercise you will deliver the following:
* JavaScript, HTML and other resources required to run your application.
* At least one screenshot of your application
* An explanation of the technologies used
* directions for starting your web app

###Notes
* Your application does not need to utilitze an application server. Ideally it
will run simply by opening an HTML file in a web browser.
* Specify the browser you tested with. Either Chrome or Firefox is fine.
