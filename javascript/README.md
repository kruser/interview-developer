#JavaScript/UI/UX Coding Exercise
============================
For this exercise you will be developing a mini web application for viewing the Cubs MLB
team roster. 

Use the [roster.json](roster.json) file that describes the Cubs current roster to
drive your application.

Required Features:
* The user must be able to save and view short text notes on any player.

Upon completion you will deliver the following:
* JavaScript, HTML and other resources required to run your application.
* At least one screenshot of your application
* An explanation of the technologies used
* directions for starting your web app

###Notes
* Your application does not need to utilitze an application server. Ideally it
will run simply by opening an HTML file in a web browser.
* Specify the browser you tested with. Either Chrome or Firefox is fine.
* For this simple exercise you should use HTML5 web storage to save the notes
on a player.
